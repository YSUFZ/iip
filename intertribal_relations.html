                Indigenous Peoples, like mentioned in the previous page, had organized them into several sovereign nations with complex culture, laws, and government. Long story short, they were their own civilization. And like any civilization, the different tribes interacted with each other. Sometimes it was to make treaties, and sometimes it was to fight war, or sometimes it could be for completely random reasons.
                <br /> <br />
                Most wars fought between different tribes were territory based, and were fought due to maybe one side using the other's territory, or one side trying to sieze the other's territory.
