                Indigenous Peoples in Canada, once it was founded, had to live by the laws of the Government of Canada, most notably, the <i>Indian Act.</i> This act stripped Indigenous Peoples of all their rights to self-determination, and to self-government, going against UNDRIP, which state, in articles three and four:
                <br /> <br />
                <i>
                    ARTICLE 3: <br />
                    Indigenous Peoples have the right to <b>self-determination</b>. By virtue of that right they freely determine their political status and freely pursue their economic, social, and cultural development.
                    <br /> <br />
                    ARTICLE 4: <br />
                    Indigenous Peoples, in exercising their right to <b>self-determination</b>, have the right to <b>autonomy or self-government</b> in matters relating to their <b>internal and local affairs</b>, as well as ways and means for financing their autonomous functions
                </i>
                <br /> <br />
                Even as the UNDRIP states that Indigenous Peoples have the right to self-determination in matters relating to their local affairs, the Canadian Government of the time had assigned each First Nations group to an agent, who would manage with the affairs and decision making within the First Nations
