                Indigenous People, prior to European Contact, organized themselves into various sovereign nations, with culture, language, food, laws, and most importantly, at least for this topic, government. Their society was matriarchal, meaning that it were women, who took the jobs of leadership.
                <br /> <br />
                When European Colonists came, among other things they took, they stripped the Indigenous Peoples of their governments. This breaks the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (or UNDRIP for short), which states in article thee and four that Indigenous peopels have the right to both self-determination and self-government, relating to internal affairs.
                <br /> <br />
                Since we're here to look at Indigenous government, let's look at how they used to govern themselves. Historians divide First Nations into groups based on their geological areas. There are six groups: The Woodland First Nations, the Iroquoian First Nations, the Plains First Nations, the Plateau First Nations, the Pacific Coast First Nations, and the First Nations of the Mackenzie and Yukon River Basins. Different groups governed themselves differently. We'll be specifically looking at two groups: the Woodland First Nations, the Iroquoian First Nations
                <br /> <br />
                The Woodland First Nations were mainly made up of independant groups, each with its own hunting territories. The leader of this nation would win his position because he possessed great courage or was a skillful hunter.
                <br /> <br />
                Iroquoians were farmers, and had very complex governmental systems based on democratic principles. It was slightly difficult to find information on how exactly these complex governments worked in the past, but an article on the official Iroquois Nations <a href="https://www.haudenosauneeconfederacy.com/government/">website</a> seems to show that each tribe had a chief, a clan mother (looks for the welfare of the tribe), and faith keepers, who promote ceremonial ways and culture. I don't know if this it the system of government that had always been used, but it is was I've found.
